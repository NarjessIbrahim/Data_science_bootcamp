## About the Project
This project focuses on data collection, storage, and visualization for articles from Al Mayadeen. It involves scraping article metadata and content, storing it in MongoDB, creating APIs to query the data, and providing visualizations using amCharts.

### Features
- Scrapes articles and stores them in JSON files.
- Stores collected data in MongoDB.
- Provides Flask APIs for querying and aggregating data.
- Creates various interactive charts using amCharts.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: For web scraping and API development.
- **Flask**: To create APIs.
- **MongoDB**: For data storage.
- **amCharts**: For visualizing data.
- **TextBlob** and **Stanza**: For text analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Python installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed locally.
- Basic knowledge of Python, Flask, and web scraping techniques.

### Installation
Install the required libraries:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml pymongo flask amcharts-python

Set up MongoDB and ensure it's running.

### Usage
## Scraping Data (Task 1)
To scrape articles and save them as JSON files:
python web_scraper.py
JSON files will be saved.

## Storing Data (Task 2)
To store the scraped data in MongoDB:
python data_storage.py
Data will be stored in the articles collection in MongoDB.

## API Development (Task 2)
To start the Flask server and access the API:
python app.py
Access the endpoints via http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## API Endpoints:
/top_keywords: Get top 10 keywords.
/top_authors: Get top 10 authors.
/articles_by_date: Get article counts by date.
/articles_by_word_count: Get article counts by word count.
and more ...

## Data Visualization (Task 3)
To visualize the data, start the Flask server and open the dashboard.html file in the browser. It will display interactive charts for various metrics such as top keywords, articles by date, and more.

## Advanced Data Analysis (Task 4)
In this task, sentiment analysis and entity recognition are performed using TextBlob/Stanza. To run sentiment analysis and extract entities:

## New endpoints include:
/articles_by_sentiment/<sentiment_type>: Get articles with positive sentiment.
/articles_by_entity/<entity>: Get articles mentioning specific entities.
/sentiment_trends: Visualize sentiment trends over time.
/keyword_trends/<keyword>: Visualize keyword trends over time.
